           <h1> Love Time</h1>

<p>If I could have all the time in the world,<br>
I know what I would do:,<br>
I’d spend the time<br>
In pleasure sublime,<br>
Just by being with you.</p>

<p>By Joanna Fuchs</p>

<h1>Idle Dreams</h1>

<p>In idle dreams of long ago,<br>
I imagined my true love;<br>
A perfect match, a soulmate,<br>
An angel from above.

Now you’re here, and now I know<br>
Our love will stay and thrive and grow.</p>

<p>By Joanna Fuchs</p>

<h1>Simply Love</h1>

<p>Happy, full and rich is my life;<br>
Contentment is all I see.<br>
Why all the rapture, joy, delight?<br>
It’s simply because you love me.</p>

<p>By Joanna Fuchs</p>

<h1>I Always Will</h1>

<p>I loved you then,<br>
And I love you still;<br>
I adore you now,<br>
And I always will.</p>

<p>By Joanna Fuchs</p>

 <h1>‘The First Day’.</h1>

<p>I wish I could remember that first day,<br>
First hour, first moment of your meeting me,<br>
If bright or dim the season, it might be<br>
Summer or Winter for aught I can say;<br>
So unrecorded did it slip away,<br>
So blind was I to see and to foresee,<br>
So dull to mark the budding of my tree<br>
That would not blossom yet for many a May …</p>

<p>Christina Rossetti,</p>

<h1>‘Now sleeps the crimson petal, now the white’.</h1>

<p>Now sleeps the crimson petal, now the white;<br>
Nor waves the cypress in the palace walk;<br>
Nor winks the gold fin in the porphyry font.<br>
The firefly wakens; waken thou with me.<br>

Now droops the milk-white peacock like a ghost,<br>
And like a ghost she glimmers on to me.<br>
Now lies the Earth all Danaë to the stars,<br>
And all thy heart lies open unto me …</p>

<p>Alfred, Lord Tennyson,</p>

<h1>Sonnet 29.</h1>

<p>Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,<br>
Haply I think on thee, and then my state,<br>
Like to the lark at break of day arising<br>
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven’s gate;<br>
For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings<br>
That then I scorn to change my state with kings.</p>

<p>William Shakespeare</p>

<h1>‘To lose thee, sweeter than to gain’.
</h1>
<p>To lose thee — sweeter than to gain<br>
All other hearts I knew.<br>
’Tis true the drought is destitute,<br>
But then, I had the dew!<br>

The Caspian has its realms of sand,<br>
Its other realm of sea.<br>
Without the sterile perquisite,<br>
No Caspian could be.</p>
<p>Emily Dickinson,</p>T
