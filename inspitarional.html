           <h1> When Is That Golden Moment?</h1>
<p>When the scale tells me I’ve not gained a pound<br>
When my glasses or phone or keys have been found,<br>
When the cop pulls me over but spares me the ticket<br>
When my ice cream cone drips and I get to lick it,<br>
When I read the obituaries and don’t know a soul,<br>
When the car just ahead of me pays for my toll,<br>
When my pants can fit without sucking my gut in<br>
When I’m on the dance floor and a man asks to cut in,<br>
When it’s time for a movie and I get to choose it,<br>
When I cut out the coupon and remember to use it.<br>
Everyone understands the worth<br>
Of a big celebration: a marriage, a birth<br>
But moments of joy, too many to mention<br>
Brighten each day, when we just pay attention.</p>

<h1>Bloom</h1>
<p>I want to tell you<br>
about the sunflower I found<br>
on the sidewalk yesterday.<br>
It is wilting and curled and gorgeous<br>
and knows it.<br>

I want to age like that,<br>
never forgetting my own beauty,<br>
never forgetting how to say bloom</p><br>

<p>By Anna Voelker</p>


<h1>First Fires</h1>
<p>When I was little I used to flip to the last page of my chosen library book<br>
first<br>
and read it aloud to myself.<br>
I thought by doing this I would be made privy to some secret information.<br>
I could outsmart the author and figure it all out before he or she intended<br>.
I could win.<br>
Everything was a game.<br>
Nowadays, I avoid the last page as long as possible.<br>
I abandon books all over my apartment.<br>
One lays with its spine cracked open on the arm of my couch<br>
while another curls on the floor under my bed asleep.<br>
I don’t want to get to the end of anything anymore.<br>
I only want beginnings:<br>
First sentences striking like matches on the roof of my mouth.<br>
Igniting like the first fires on earth.</p>

 <p>By Dorothy Schultz</p>


<h1>Constellations</h1>
<p>My favorite color is navy blue,<br>
the color of a childhood book about stars.<br>
My father read it to me on the couch,<br>
took me outside and showed me<br>
the Big Dipper, and the Little Dipper,<br>
and how to find the North Star.<br>
All of this was right in front of our house.<br>
We looked up into the sky until it looked back.<br>
The book said we spin without realizing it.<br>
It told where we are in the Milky Way<br>
but my father and I don’t know how we got here.<br>
Neither of us mentions it.<br>
We do not know how to do the math<br>
on astronomical odds as big as that.</p>
